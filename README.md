## Introduction

TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project.

## Getting Started

## Install
- Install the latest .NET 9 SDK.

## Git Configuration

Since we are working with rebase the following git settings are useful:

- `git config rerere.enabled true`: automatically resolve conflicts when they were already solved at some point
- `git config pull.rebase true`: always rebase on pull
- `git config rebase.autostash true`: automatically stash work before rebase and pop it afterward

- TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:

1. Installation process
2. Software dependencies
3. Latest releases
4. API references
